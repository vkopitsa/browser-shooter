## Overview

Browser Shooter is a fast-paced 3D FPS built with **Three.js** and **React**. Everything — rendering, physics, audio, AI, networking, and game logic — runs client-side. There is **no game server**: multiplayer is peer-to-peer over WebRTC, with one player acting as the host-authoritative simulation.

It ships with two distinct experiences:

- 🧟 **Singleplayer** — Classic arena **wave survival**. Fight escalating waves of enemies, collect pickups, chase a persistent high score. Add AI bots to fill out the arena.
- 🔫 **Multiplayer** — Peer-to-peer **PvP** with a full **CS-style competitive mode**: Terrorists vs. Counter-Terrorists, round-based play, a plantable/defusable **C4 bomb objective**, a money **economy**, and a **buy menu** — on five hand-built competitive maps, with AI teammates and opponents.

## Game Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Singleplayer — Wave Survival** | Survive progressively harder waves of Grunts, Runners, and Tanks. Health/ammo pickups spawn between waves. High score persists in `localStorage`. |
| **Multiplayer — Deathmatch / PvP** | Host or join a room over WebRTC. Host-authoritative simulation with lag compensation and client-side prediction. |
| **Multiplayer — Competitive (CS-style)** | Round-based CT vs. T play with a bomb objective, per-round economy, a buy phase, and a match score (first to the configured round limit). Fill empty slots with **AI bots**. |

## Features

- **Two full game modes** — solo wave survival and peer-to-peer multiplayer, including CS-style competitive.
- **Bomb objective** — Terrorists carry and plant the C4 at site A or B; Counter-Terrorists race to defuse (faster with a defuse kit). Plant/defuse timers, explosion, and win conditions are fully simulated.
- **Economy & buy menu** — Earn money from kills, wins, and losses; spend it each round on weapons, armor, grenades, a defuse kit, and utility upgrades.
- **Deep weapon roster** — Pistols (USP, Glock, Deagle), rifles (M4, AUG, AK-47, Galil), MP5, Shotgun, and the AWP, each with distinct damage, fire rate, spread, range, and reload.
- **Grenades** — HE grenade, Flashbang (with screen-flash blinding), and Smoke grenade, with full and short throws.
- **AI bots** — CS-style team bots that buy, navigate, fight, and play the objective. Add/remove them on the fly.
- **Five competitive maps** — Dust II, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, and Overpass, selectable from the room setup.
- **Voice chat** — In-game push-to-talk voice over the peer mesh, with on-screen speaker indicators.
- **Configurable crosshair** — Live crosshair editor with dynamic bloom that reacts to movement and firing.
- **Enemy variety & AI** — Grunts, Runners, and Tanks with chase/attack behavior and difficulty scaling.
- **Particle & visual effects** — Muzzle flash, bullet-impact sparks, blood splatter, death explosions, damage vignette, flash overlay.
- **Spatial audio** — Web Audio API with HRTF spatialization, pitch variation, and synthesized fallbacks.
- **Rich HUD** — Health/armor, ammo, weapon & money indicators, round/score state, kill feed, minimap, scoreboard, respawn and match-over overlays.
- **Server directory & matchmaking** — Browse, filter, and ping public rooms, or use quick matchmaking.
- **Mobile-ready** — Responsive UI with on-screen touch controls and a rotate hint for portrait devices.

| [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) | End-to-end browser testing (10 spec files) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hermes98761234/browser-shooter.git
cd browser-shooter
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test             # Run all unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e     # Run E2E tests (Playwright, Chromium)
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build        # Production build → dist/
npm run preview      # Preview the production build locally
```

## Multiplayer Broker

Multiplayer signalling runs over PeerJS. By default the app uses the **public `0.peerjs.com` cloud broker**, which is rate-limited — heavy testing can earn a temporary Cloudflare `1015` IP ban, after which room codes and the server list stop appearing. To avoid that, run your own broker:

```bash
npm run peerserver   # local PeerJS broker on :9000
```

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, uncomment the `VITE_PEER_*` lines, and restart `npm run dev`. For two machines on a LAN, set `VITE_PEER_HOST` to the broker host's LAN IP. With no `.env.local`, the app keeps using the public broker.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers GitHub Actions:

1. **CI** — Lint, unit tests, E2E tests, and a production build.
2. **Deploy** — Automatic deployment to [GitHub Pages](https://hermes98761234.github.io/browser-shooter/).

Tag with `v*` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to trigger a release build with a distributable zip attached to the GitHub Release.

## Known Follow-ups

PvP is functional and host-authoritative. Two client-side polish gaps remain (the host side is correct):

- [ ] **Client lobby rosters are empty.** The host knows who is on CT vs T but doesn't broadcast roster/team changes, so a joined client's roster panels render empty. Fix: have the host push the roster (names + teams) to clients on join and on `setTeam`.
- [ ] **Client kill feed shows raw player IDs.** Remote players aren't in the client's local player map, so the client kill feed prints e.g. `player-2`. Fix: carry attacker/victim names in the `playerKilledPlayer` event (or resolve them from the snapshot).
